Hello there everyone!

Just someone aspiring to learn code and have fun while doing it. I've gone through HTML and CSS now I am onto bootstrap and then Javascript! I look forward to learning from everyone and improving myself to move on to a career in the world of web and software development. Happy coding and don't mind me too much!
